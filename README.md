# Hate-Speech Detection using HurtLex

The main purpose of this project is to enhance our mother language version of HurtLex
and build a model to detect hate-speech automatically.
We worked on both Arabic and English Langauges. We used the lexicons in
statistical methods to analyze our dataset. Then we tested three different
classification algorithms with different types of features.

# Dataset

We collected our data from different resources. In total we have 41991 tweets
annotated with three labels "hateful", "offensive", "normal". 

# Main Steps

1. We started with pre-processing the data
2. Apply a simple classification using only the lexicon
3. Extract the features
4. Test our classification models show reults
